## Background

I have always been fascinated with all ways we use technolog. From networking, camera systems to databases and the list goes on. So before I started working with the treaty office. I recieved my associate's degree in computer technology. From there I moved forward with my schooling but at that time the courses I needed for my second degree were limited in our area. Since then I spend 12 years working with the Rosebud Sioux Tribe IT department. In my 12 years working with our tribe, my goal has always been to help our people catch up with the rest of the world as we move into the future of technology.
