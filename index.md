* #### About me

Im an IT Specialist with the Treaty Office for the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.  I will be working on our climate center project, along with another IT Specialist. Our main focus for this project is to gather Environmental Data and input the data of what we gathered into our Climate Center Dashboard.  Once the project is complete we will be training our surrounding tribes with their data input and how to use the dashboard.
